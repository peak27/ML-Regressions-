# Regressions (w/ Python & R)
This repository consists ofvarious regression techniques such as Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest regression, and Support Vector Regression.


# **Project name:** Regressions (w/ Python & R)

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regression is the preocess of predicting the values of each individuals from dependent variables based on theie information available on independent variables. Also regressions can determine the effects of some exploratory variable on the dependent variable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository, we are focusing on building complex statistical regression models to predict and visualize the prediction results only on continous dependent variables. Mostly, based on the nature of datapoints (Scatterplot) and the correlation between dependent and independent variables, we can decide which model is appropriate for the given dataset and what variables are important for the model building process.


## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * R (For R implementation)

## Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regression methodes are very common term and technique in the field of data science. You can use these regression methods to predict the continous dependent variables such as salary of individuals, total sales of the year, age of a person and more.

## Contributing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can implement multiple models on the same dataset to determine the most accurate model.

## Credits 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an individual project.
